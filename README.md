<summary>🌟 Inspiration</summary>

Most people don’t fail because they’re lazy — they fail because their lives are chaotic 🌀, overloaded 🧠, and full of friction ⚡.  
Existing productivity apps ✅ track tasks, but none think strategically 🧭 or adapt like a personal Chief of Staff 🤖.  
So we built **Aether** — a system that turns ambition into precision 🎯, goals into systems 🧩, and chaos into clarity 🌈.
